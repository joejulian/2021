# 2021

2020 sucked big oily rocks. Let's never do that again! So in true open source spirit, let's make 2021 a better year by doing what we can to ensure that each of us becomes a better version of ourselves. 

Here is some brainstorming about what we can do:

* build on anti-racism movements
   * add more support for the black lives matter movement
   * deplatform white supremacist vigilantes / neo-confederates
   * make the world safe for our LGBTQ friends
* care for those hit by COVID
   * support food banks
   * support local businesses
   * make sure relief package legislation passes

* other things under consideration..
   * fix 2020? If 2021 is an improvement, can we retroactively apply patches to 2020? Will have to think about this a bit...
   * would we have to apply patches to a forked branch of 2020? Will they both run simultaneously???
